Then, query the index with the *anchors* and evaluate how often the correct hit (i.e. the corresponding *positive* to the query *anchor*) is in top 1 and how often it is in top 5 (say). In other words, you are evaluating the accuracy of the retrieval. "

    "So now that we have done embedding calculations, created an index and even written some querying functions, it should be super easy to search the index and determine how \"good\" it is and how \"well\" it works. In order to provide some demonstration, but then also keep my sanity, I'm going to write a script that takes 20 random samples from our data, uses the `embeddingBasedSearch` function and `k = 5` and searches the index. My hypotheses is that the correct positive will be the \\#1 result at least 90% of the time (so at least 18 out of 20 times) and in the top 5 100% of the time. Let's write and run the code!"

    "So with this particular output 19 of the 20 tests produced a \\#1 match! And the remaining 1 question was a \\#2 match. There the question was \"Which are the best movies of 2016?\", the \\#1 match was \"What is the best film of 2016?\" and the correct answer (\\#2 match) was \"Which was the best film of 2016?\". So basically the system not finding the \"correct\" duplicate was due to several duplicates existing within the data; We can safely say that if the system's goal is to find duplicates, than it did its job perfectly despite not flagging the \"correct\" duplicate as the most likely match.<br>\n",

    "Based on this one run (not enough for a scientific analysis, but good enough for this demonstration), I can conclude: Yes, the system indeed appears to be working. Although there was one run when I was writing the script where the system did actually find one query where the correct answer wasn't in the top 5, which is curious. However I did not save that run, and I'm not willing to go comb the 2000 datapoints I have to find that one outlier again, that is not the point of this exercise.<br>\n",

I now also want to run that function just for fun and to show that it works & stuff. Since the very first item in the dataset is about astrology, I'm gonna use the question \"Should I believe in astrology?\" as my query."
