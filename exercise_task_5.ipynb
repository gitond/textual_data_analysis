    "NER inference using a sequence labeling model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, your task is to extract named entities from the Finnish/English news data collection using fine-tuned sequence labeling model, investigate its predictions, and calculate simple NE statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Finnish/English news data collection is available here: http://dl.turkunlp.org/TKO_8964_2023/news-*.jsonl.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do the exercise using Finnish data, the suggested fine-tuned model is https://huggingface.co/Kansallisarkisto/finbert-ner. For English, there are many options, but e.g. https://huggingface.co/dslim/bert-base-NER is a reasonable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Read the model page to figure out which datasets were used to train the model, and which entities the model includes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Run inference on the news data, and verify whether the model produces invalid label sequences (hint: it does if you run on some amount of data). Here you do not need to take into account subwords to tokens -mapping, but you can directly check the label sequence of subwords (raw predictions). Print statistics for the most common invalid transitions. Hint: If you run the inference using pipeline, it may hide some of the predictions from you. Set the pipeline parameters so that you get access to raw predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Read about the ´aggregation_strategy´ parameter for token classification pipelines (sometimes source code is the best place to get information...). Based on your reading, select a suitable parameter (or in case you run the inference without using pipelines, write a simple function to implement some simple aggregation strategy), run the inference, and collect predicted named entities. What is the most common entity type in your data and what are the most common entities?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's totally fine to downsample the data, e.g. 50 documents is more than enough and can be easily done on CPU. With GPU runtime, one can run substantial amount of data."

      "{\"summary\": \"Despite an increase in Covid hospitalisations, Helsingin Sanomat finds no backing among key MPs for vaccination mandates in Finland.\", \"tags\": [\"Kotimaan uutiset\"], \"text\": \"The Helsinki tabloid  Ilta-Sanomat looks at the latest figures  for Covid hospitalisations in Finland, pointing out that at a Thursday press conference,  Pasi Pohjola  of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health said that non-vaccinated people accounted for 74 percent of coronavirus patients receiving hospital care in September. \\n \\\"The epidemic situation has clearly deteriorated, affecting, of course, the unvaccinated population and, to some extent, those who are only protected by one dose. This raises questions about what measures can be taken to reverse the situation,\\\" Pohjola said. \\n Over the past two weeks, according to the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), unvaccinated 12-79-year-olds have been hospitalised 14 times more often than people in the same age group who have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine. \\n Last week, 22 new Covid patients were rushed to intensive care, IS noted. Pohjola estimated that nationwide, Finland has the capacity to provide about 50 intensive care units for coronavirus patients. Once that critical point is exceeded, a lack of hospital resources would begin to be reflected in other medical treatments requiring intensive care, he added. \\n IS further writes that Helsinki University Hospital Chief Physician  Asko Järvinen  told the paper earlier this week that he does not yet know of a single fully vaccinated person who has been  treated in an intensive care unit  in his hospital. \\n \\\"No\\\" to vaccination mandate \\n Finland's largest circulation daily,  Helsingin Sanomat , reports that even with an upswing in infections and the slowing pace of vaccination uptake, the nation's main political parties are not in favour of  reimposing restrictions . \\n HS asked MPs from the six largest parliamentary parties what measures should be taken to deal with the worsening situation. \\n The paper posed the question of what should be done to ensure that citizens who are hesitant and critical of vaccines also take two doses of a coronavirus vaccine. \\n Antti Lindtman , chair of the SDP's parliamentary group: \\\"More measures are needed to keep the vaccination threshold as low as possible, more walk-in points and vaccine buses are needed. Enhanced, targeted information is needed for groups and areas where vaccination coverage is still low.\\\" \\n Ville Tavio ,  c hair of the Finns Party's parliamentary group: \\\"No action is needed. It is a voluntary choice for every adult whether or not to take the vaccine. News about the coronavirus has been reported every day of the year, so I find it quite unlikely that anyone does not know that vaccination is recommended.\\\" \\n National Coalition MP  Mia Laiho : \\\"Vaccinations must be available, at a low threshold in places where people move about. This needs to be intensified. It is important to provide information about the benefits, but also the side effects of the vaccines, so that there is a wider understanding of how few side effects there are in relation to the number of people vaccinated in the world.\\\" \\n Juha Pylväs , chair of the Centre Party's parliamentary group: \\\"We need to educate people more about vaccines and make vaccination as easy as possible. Add pop-up points where you can get vaccines constantly and easily.\\\" \\n Emma Kari , chair of the Greens parliamentary group: \\\"There is a need for more encouragement and imaginative campaigns to get unvaccinated people to take the jabs. The dissemination of false information must be addressed.\\\" \\n Jussi Saramo , chair of the parliamentary group of the Left Alliance: \\\"Raising awareness is the most important thing, because there is so much misinformation circulating.\\\" \\n Should compulsory vaccination be introduced? \\n SDP’s Lindtman: \\\"Coercion wouldn't work in this situation. I am afraid that it would change attitudes towards vaccines.\\\" \\n Tavio of the Finns Party: \\\"It is not necessary.\\\" \\n NCP's Laiho: \\\"As a matter of principle, the National Coalition Party does not support mandated vaccinations, but it is necessary to assess whether vaccinations could be required for those in jobs working with people at risk.\\\" \\n Centre Party's Pylväs: \\\"The Centre has a negative attitude towards compulsory vaccinations.\\\" \\n Greens' Kari: \\\"We want to trust that people want to take care of each other and take the vaccines. I would not move towards forced vaccination.\\\" \\n Left Alliance's Saramo: \\\" I do not support mandated vaccination.\\\" \\n Climate demos to continue \\n \\\"We do not do it because we think it's fun, but because we have to,\\\" Elokapina climate activist spokesperson  Kaisamaija Uljas  told the Swedish-language daily  Hufvudstadsbladet  when asked about the recent protests blocking traffic in the capital. \\n A protest by the group -- which is the the Finnish branch of the environmental group Extinction Rebellion -- on Wednesday,  blocked traffic for several hours on a bridge  near the city centre. The action came without warning. \\n \\\"It was quite spontaneous. We did not want the police to get there before us, so that we could block the road properly and reach out with our message to more people,\\\" Uljas explained. \\n Hufvudstadsbladet writes that this week the movement sent out invitations to a number of politicians asking them to meet for discussions on climate issues. \\n None of those invited came. \\n This week's episode of All Points North asked if Finland afford not to act on climate change. You can listen to the full podcast using the embedded player here, via Yle Areena, Spotify or Apple Podcasts or on your usual podcast player using the RSS feed. Paper review continues after audio. \\n \\\"Unfortunately, our message has not been received the way we wanted. That is why we must continue to protest,\\\" Uljas told the paper, adding that Elokapina has plans for more actions like the protest closing the bridge in Helsinki on Wednesday. \\n While she did not provide details to Hufvudstadsbladet, when asked if similar protests will be seen on Friday or over the weekend, Uljas replied, \\\"Yes, we can promise that.\\\" \\n A total of 123 people were arrested in connection with Elokapina's protest on Wednesday. Hufvudstadsbladet reports that about 1,000 people say they are active participants in the protest movement. \\n Firewood vending machines \\n The  Oulu-based Kaleva  tells readers the tale of how  Valto Vaaraniemi , a project worker at the Centre for Sustainable Development, came up against a not uncommon problem when stopping at a camp site while canoeing on the Äkäsjoki river. \\n \\\"We were all wet and found that there was no firewood at the campfire site at all. It was cold and we would have liked to roast some sausages. At that moment, we thought that we would have been willing to pay for some wood,\\\" Vaaraniemi recalls. \\n At first it was a joke, the idea of a firewood vending machine at campsites. Soon after, however, the matter was under serious design planning at the Centre for Sustainable Development, and the City of Oulu gave a green light to the proposal. \\n Last winter, the hardware was created, and Oulu University of Applied Sciences student  Juho Kettunen  devoted his thesis to designing the software to run it. \\n The first public firewood vending machine was installed at a camping site in Oulu this week. The site previously had supplies of wood on hand for campers, but they tended to get stolen as soon as they were delivered. \\n Purchases are made by mobile phone, entering the vending machine code and choosing a payment method, causing a door to pop open revealing a stack of firewood. \\n A large \\\"armful\\\" of ready firewood costs 3.95 euros. The vending machine has 30 hatches, and the device notifies the Centre for Sustainable Development when the wood starts running low. \\n The plan is now to test the machine to see how well it functions during the cold winter months, and if a success, to install them at more sites in and around Oulu.\", \"timestamp\": \"2021-10-08T07:37:57\", \"title\": \"Friday's papers: Covid upswing, climate protests and a firewood vending machine\", \"url\": \"https://yle.fi/uutiset/12134305\"}\n",

      " \"All of us refugees are worried right now. As things currently stand, Migri could decide to send us back to Afghanistan the second our permits expire. Those of us who have lived under the Taliban already know that the country will not be safe any time soon,\" he told Yle News. \n",
      " Munir received multiple negative decisions from Migri, being granted a temporary residence permit in 2019 that is due to expire next year. He has not been contacted by Migri since deportations were suspended in July. \n",

      " An Afghan mother and daughter in a Helsinki park. Terhi Liimu / Yle \n",
      " Munir explained that \"everything has changed since the Taliban took over\" and that he fears for himself and for his family. They remain stuck in Kabul, unable to leave since Finland suspended family reunification at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. He also describes the uncertainty of his situation and not knowing if he will ever be reunited with his wife as the worst part of his ordeal. \n",
      " \"If the [Finnish] government hates us and does not want us in this country, it would be easier if they just said so. It is so much worse not knowing whether we will be able to build a life here,\" he said. \n",
      " \"This is mental torture\" \n",
      " \"I am just so tired at the moment,\" said  Abdul* , an Afghan asylum seeker in his early twenties who has been in Finland for six years. Despite arriving when he was underage, Abdul has only received negative decisions on multiple asylum applications. His most recent rejection occurred while he was receiving treatment in hospital for a serious illness, despite his doctor writing a letter to Migri requesting that they take his deteriorating health into consideration. \n",
      " \"This whole process has completely worn me down. My mental health is in a terrible state and Migri’s treatment of me is basically mental torture,\" he said. \"I miss my mother, but she is not able to come here.\" \n",
      " Prior to Migri’s decision to suspend deportations in July, more than a third of Afghan asylum seekers had their  applications rejected , with some being sent back as recently as June. Most Afghan asylum seekers were sent to Kabul, as this was one of the only parts of the country designated as sufficiently safe. \n",
      " Abdul says he received a letter from Migri last month informing him that removal proceedings against him had been dropped, but that he has received no further guidance on what to do next. \n",
      " Need for clarity \n",
      " Katja Mannerström , Head of Public Affairs at the Finnish Refugee Council ( Suomen Pakolaisapu ) says that there is a \"huge need\" for greater clarity from the authorities right now, and that those in need are suffering without it. \n",
      " \"All of our phones have been ringing constantly since the Taliban took over,\" explained Mannerström. \"There are a lot of false rumours flying around, since Migri is not proactively contacting people who have had their negative decisions overturned.\" \n",
      " She urged anyone seeking asylum to re-apply if they have recently received a negative decision, in line with Migri's guidance. She also noted that Migri has loosened its criteria for asylum seekers who can apply for a so-called Alien Passport, which makes it easier to open a bank account and apply for jobs and housing in Finland. \n",
      " Despite these recent moves, Mannerström describes the current asylum process in Finland as \"mentally breaking,\" with many Afghans waiting more than six years for a decision. \n",
      " \"This is something that Finland needs to do better. It is obvious that Afghanistan has not been safe for at least the last six years and that there are a lot of people who should have been granted asylum but weren’t,\" she said. \n",
      " Refugee NGO concerned about protection \n",
      " Pia Lindfors , Executive Director of the Refugee Advice Centre (Pakolaisneuvonta) says that simply suspending negative decisions for the time being is not an adequate solution, and that more needs to be done to help vulnerable people. \n",
      " Article continues after photo \n",
      " Pia Lindfors, Executive Director of the Refugee Advice Centre Yle Svenska / Jessica Stoltzmann \n",
      " \"We have never seen anything like this,\" said Lindfors. \"Even before the events of the summer, the never-ending limbo that Afghan asylum seekers are subjected to by Migri and the courts has taken a devastating toll. Some of our clients are really falling apart right now.\" \n",
      " According to Lindfors, her group is not entirely confident that Afghans in Finland will receive the protection and reassurances to which they are entitled. In her view, Migri’s previous actions, based on decisions by previous governments, amounted to \"creating a hostile environment\" to force them to leave. \n",
      " She also says that the tendency of the Finnish system to apply a \"very strict interpretation of the law\" meant that many deserving applicants have been rejected despite being guaranteed protection under UNHCR guidelines. \n",
      " \"Across the whole of the EU, the system is currently failing, even though it looks good on paper,\" said Lindfors. \"The rhetoric we are seeing across the EU right now suggests that the environment towards Afghans will become more hostile in the future, which doesn’t bode well for people who are already here.\" \n",
      " \"They could kill us at any moment\" \n",
      " While asylum seekers in Finland have received some reprieve, those who have already been sent back to Afghanistan face even greater difficulties. \n",
      " \"They could kill us at any moment. I wait up every night for the Taliban to come to our house,\" said  Jamil* , a journalist currently in Kabul with his family, after leaving Finland in 2018 following a negative decision from Migri. \n",
      " In Jamil’s official rejection letter seen by Yle, Migri acknowledged that he could be targeted by the Taliban for his work but concluded that he could be reasonably safe in the capital if he kept a low profile and did not continue openly working as a journalist. Migri also acknowledged in the letter that Jamil’s colleagues and acquaintances had been targeted and even killed by the Taliban, but that this did not constitute a significant enough threat to his own safety to warrant a positive asylum decision. \n",
      " \"Nobody can trust the Taliban; they have already started killing journalists here,\" said Jamil by phone from his home in Kabul. \n",
      " Jamil also described the Finnish evacuation effort as \"surprising,\" saying that he and his peers in Finland had expected the embassy to evacuate tens of thousands of people, as opposed to just over 400. \n",
      " \"We asked for help from Finnish officials during the evacuation and they said that we were not eligible for assistance. Afghanistan is not safe for journalists, and I hope that Migri will correct its mistakes and give me and my family another chance,\" he said. \n",
      " Migri urges people to re-apply for asylum  \n",
      " Antti Lehtinen , Director of Migri's Asylum Unit, told Yle News that anyone from Afghanistan who has received a final negative decision should re-apply now, so that their need for international protection can be re-examined. \n",
      " Article continues after photo \n",
      " A Migri service point (file photo) Antti Aimo-Koivisto / Lehtikuva \n",
      " Lehtinen added that anyone who is undocumented can come forward and re-apply without negative consequences, as \"the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated rapidly\" in recent months and previous decisions do not apply. \n",
      " Asked whether authorities should have designated Afghanistan as unsafe earlier and stopped deporting people before the summer, Lehtinen replied that Migri \"always uses accurate country of origin information\" provided by agencies such as the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), which plays a major role in the EU’s common refugee policy. \n",
      " He noted that EASO will be releasing revised country guidance information for Afghanistan \"sometime in November\" and that Migri will issue new information for refugees after this. Until then, Migri urges Afghan asylum seekers to be patient. \n",
      " \"Altogether, we have more than 2,600 hundred asylum cases pending at the moment. We have a lot on our plate, so it may take time for everyone to receive their decisions. However, know that we are not issuing negative decisions or removals for Afghans at this point,\" said Lehtinen. \n",
      " Afghans seeking guidance on the updated asylum policies and their rights can find information on the Migri website in  Dari  and  English . Guidance on applying for an Alien Passport is also available  here . \n",
